# QuoTam
Eaton process improvement project, summer 2018 

This project is designed to help in the process of customer quoting. By parsing an excel version of the provided BOM, and creating a dictionary of device names, the program identifies how many of each device exist. The results can then be further examined using Ctrl + F.
